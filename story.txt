Johnny, an average man in every way possible, is about to have a life-changing day. Johnny is thirty-three years old and lives in the northeast section of Madison, where the lake and Memorial Union are, and is not married. He works as an employee for the nearby Badger Markets, and gets home every day by 8 PM at the latest. He wishes to live a very quiet life and takes care not to trouble himself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause him to lose sleep at night. It's how he deals with society, and he knows that is what brings him happiness. However, as he stepped outside of the comfort of his home, he was confronted by something intimidating and quite bizarre.
